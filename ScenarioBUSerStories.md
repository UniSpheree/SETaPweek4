“How do you manage placements”
I am currently using a spreadsheet and put in bullet points placements I am interested in, such as the company name, location and placement dates. I also colour code my spreadsheet.

“What’s your current frustrations”
It is really hard to keep track of deadlines, finding keywords within the placement description and its frustrating to filter my partially completed and submitted applications.

“How broad is your searches, do you look at multiple websites or do you look at a job board to give all info?”
As a student I want to use multiple websites to look at interesting placements.

“What do you expect a placement board want to do?”
I should be able to search through applications, have the ability to cluster applications based on status and want a timeline for upcoming deadlines for applications.
